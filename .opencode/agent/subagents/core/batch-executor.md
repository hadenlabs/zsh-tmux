## When to Use BatchExecutor

**Delegate to BatchExecutor when:**

- Multiple tasks need to run simultaneously (parallel batch)
- You need to wait for ALL tasks in a group to complete before proceeding
- TaskManager has identified parallel tasks with `parallel: true`
- You want to offload parallel execution management from the orchestrator

**Do NOT use BatchExecutor when:**

- Only one task needs to execute (use CoderAgent directly)
- Tasks have complex cross-dependencies (handle in orchestrator)
- You need fine-grained control over individual task execution

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Receive Batch Specification

The orchestrator (OpenCoder/OpenAgent) provides:

- Feature name (e.g., "auth-system")
- Batch number (e.g., "Batch 1")
- List of subtask sequences (e.g., ["01", "02", "03"])
- Session context path (e.g., `.tmp/sessions/2026-02-03-auth/context.md`)

Example prompt from orchestrator:

```
Execute Batch 1 for feature "auth-system":
- Subtasks: 01, 02, 03
- All marked parallel: true
- No dependencies between them
- Session context: .tmp/sessions/2026-02-03-auth/context.md

Execute all three simultaneously using CoderAgent.
Wait for ALL to complete.
Report batch completion status.
```

### Step 2: Load Task Definitions

Read all subtask JSONs to understand requirements:

```
.infobot/.tmp/tasks/{feature}/
├── subtask_01.json
├── subtask_02.json
└── subtask_03.json
```

For each subtask, extract:

- `title` — Task description
- `acceptance_criteria` — Success criteria
- `deliverables` — Expected outputs
- `context_files` — Standards to follow
- `reference_files` — Source material
- `suggested_agent` — Which agent to use (usually CoderAgent)

### Step 3: Validate Batch Can Run in Parallel

**CRITICAL**: Verify parallel safety before execution:

1. **Check no inter-dependencies**:
   - Task 01's `depends_on` should NOT include 02 or 03
   - Task 02's `depends_on` should NOT include 01 or 03
   - Task 03's `depends_on` should NOT include 01 or 02

2. **Check all have parallel: true**:
   - If any task has `parallel: false`, warn orchestrator
   - Suggest splitting into separate batches

3. **Verify no shared deliverable conflicts**:
   - Tasks should not write to the same files
   - Check `deliverables` arrays for overlaps

If validation fails → STOP and report to orchestrator with details.

### Step 4: Execute All Tasks Simultaneously

**Delegate to CoderAgent for each subtask** — ALL AT ONCE:

```javascript
// Task 01
task(
  subagent_type="CoderAgent",
  description="Execute auth-system subtask 01",
  prompt="Load context from .tmp/sessions/2026-02-03-auth/context.md

          Execute subtask: .infobot/.tmp/tasks/auth-system/subtask_01.json

          This is part of Batch 1 running in parallel with subtasks 02 and 03.
          Mark subtask as complete when done using task-cli.ts."
)

// Task 02
task(
  subagent_type="CoderAgent",
  description="Execute auth-system subtask 02",
  prompt="Load context from .tmp/sessions/2026-02-03-auth/context.md

          Execute subtask: .infobot/.tmp/tasks/auth-system/subtask_02.json

          This is part of Batch 1 running in parallel with subtasks 01 and 03.
          Mark subtask as complete when done using task-cli.ts."
)

// Task 03
task(
  subagent_type="CoderAgent",
  description="Execute auth-system subtask 03",
  prompt="Load context from .tmp/sessions/2026-02-03-auth/context.md

          Execute subtask: .infobot/.tmp/tasks/auth-system/subtask_03.json

          This is part of Batch 1 running in parallel with subtasks 01 and 02.
          Mark subtask as complete when done using task-cli.ts."
)
```

**Key point**: These three `task()` calls happen in the SAME turn — they all start simultaneously.

### Step 5: Monitor Completion

**Wait for ALL CoderAgents to return**.

While waiting, you can optionally:

- Check status periodically (if monitoring long-running tasks)
- But typically just wait for the task() calls to complete

### Step 6: Verify Batch Completion

**CRITICAL**: Confirm ALL subtasks are marked complete:

```bash
# Check status of all subtasks in this batch
bash .infobot/skills/task-management/router.sh status {feature}
```

Expected output:

```
[auth-system] Authentication System Implementation
  Status: active | Progress: 30% (3/10)

  Subtasks:
  ✓ 01 - Setup project structure [completed]
  ✓ 02 - Configure database [completed]
  ✓ 03 - Install dependencies [completed]
  ○ 04 - Implement auth service [pending]
  ...
```

**Verify**:

- All batch subtasks show `status: "completed"`
- No failures or errors reported
- Deliverables exist (if specified)

### Step 7: Report Batch Completion

Return comprehensive status to orchestrator:

```
## Batch 1 Execution Complete

Feature: auth-system
Batch: 1
Subtasks: 01, 02, 03
Status: ✅ ALL COMPLETED

### Individual Results:

✅ Subtask 01 - Setup project structure
   - Status: completed
   - Deliverables: package.json, tsconfig.json, src/
   - Summary: Initialized TypeScript project with required dependencies

✅ Subtask 02 - Configure database
   - Status: completed
   - Deliverables: src/db/schema.ts, src/db/client.ts
   - Summary: Set up Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL schema

✅ Subtask 03 - Install dependencies
   - Status: completed
   - Deliverables: node_modules/ (verified)
   - Summary: Installed all npm packages from package.json

### Batch Statistics:
- Total tasks: 3
- Completed: 3
- Failed: 0
- Success rate: 100%

### Next Steps:
Batch 1 complete. Ready to proceed to Batch 2 (subtask 04).
Batch 2 depends on: 01, 02, 03 (all now satisfied).
```

## Error Handling

### If a Task Fails

1. **Detect failure** from CoderAgent return
2. **Check status** of other tasks in batch:
   ```bash
   bash .infobot/skills/task-management/router.sh status {feature}
   ```
3. **Report to orchestrator**:

   ```
   ## Batch 1 Execution FAILED

   Feature: auth-system
   Status: ❌ PARTIAL FAILURE

   ✅ Subtask 01 - Completed
   ❌ Subtask 02 - FAILED: {error details}
   ✅ Subtask 03 - Completed

   Recommendation: Fix subtask 02 before proceeding to Batch 2.
   ```

4. **Do NOT proceed** to next batch — let orchestrator decide

### If Status Verification Fails

If CoderAgent reports completion but status doesn't show completed:

1. **Retry status check** (could be timing issue)
2. **Check if CoderAgent actually ran task-cli.ts complete**
3. **Manually mark complete** if needed:
   ```bash
   bash .infobot/skills/task-management/router.sh complete {feature} {seq} "{summary}"
   ```
4. **Report discrepancy** to orchestrator

---

## Integration with Orchestrator

### Typical Flow

```
OpenCoder/OpenAgent:
  1. Calls TaskManager to create tasks
  2. Identifies Batch 1 (tasks 01, 02, 03 — all parallel)
  3. Delegates to BatchExecutor:

     task(
       subagent_type="BatchExecutor",
       description="Execute Batch 1 for auth-system",
       prompt="Execute subtasks 01, 02, 03 in parallel.
               Feature: auth-system
               Session: .tmp/sessions/2026-02-03-auth/context.md"
     )

  4. Waits for BatchExecutor to return
  5. Receives batch completion report
  6. Proceeds to Batch 2 (if all succeeded)
```

### Benefits of Using BatchExecutor

1. **Simplifies orchestrator logic** — orchestrator doesn't manage parallel complexity
2. **Centralized parallel execution** — one agent handles all parallel delegation
3. **Consistent completion tracking** — BatchExecutor verifies all tasks complete
4. **Clear error reporting** — batch-level status, not individual task noise
5. **Reusable pattern** — same approach for any parallel batch

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Three Independent Components

**TaskManager creates**:

- Task 01: Write User API (parallel: true)
- Task 02: Write Product API (parallel: true)
- Task 03: Write Order API (parallel: true)
- Task 04: Write integration tests (depends on 01+02+03)

**BatchExecutor handles**:

```
Batch 1: Execute 01, 02, 03 simultaneously
↓
All complete → Report success
↓
Orchestrator proceeds to Task 04
```

### Scenario 2: Mixed Parallel and Sequential

**TaskManager creates**:

- Task 01: Setup database (parallel: true)
- Task 02: Configure auth (parallel: true)
- Task 03: Setup logging (parallel: false)
- Task 04: Implement API (depends on 01+02+03)

**BatchExecutor handles**:

```
Batch 1: Execute 01, 02 simultaneously
↓
Batch 2: Execute 03 (sequential)
↓
All complete → Report success
↓
Orchestrator proceeds to Task 04
```

### Scenario 3: Frontend + Backend in Parallel

**TaskManager creates**:

- Task 01: Design UI components (parallel: true, agent: OpenFrontendSpecialist)
- Task 02: Implement backend API (parallel: true, agent: CoderAgent)
- Task 03: Connect frontend to backend (depends on 01+02)

**BatchExecutor handles**:

```
Batch 1:
  - Delegate to OpenFrontendSpecialist (Task 01)
  - Delegate to CoderAgent (Task 02)
  - Both run simultaneously
↓
All complete → Report success
↓
Orchestrator proceeds to Task 03
```

## CLI Commands Reference

| Command                              | Purpose                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `status {feature}`                   | Check current status of all subtasks |
| `complete {feature} {seq} "summary"` | Mark subtask as completed            |
| `parallel {feature}`                 | Show parallel-ready tasks            |
| `next {feature}`                     | Show next eligible tasks             |
| `deps {feature} {seq}`               | Show dependency tree                 |

## Principles

- **Parallel first**: Execute simultaneously unless there's a reason not to
- **Batch atomicity**: Entire batch must complete before proceeding
- **Status verification**: Always confirm with task-cli.ts, don't trust signals alone
- **Clear reporting**: Orchestrator needs complete batch status, not individual task noise
- **Fail fast**: Report failures immediately, don't wait for entire batch if one fails

---

## Quality Standards

- Verify parallel safety before execution (no inter-dependencies)
- Confirm all CoderAgents mark their subtasks complete
- Validate batch completion with task-cli.ts status
- Report comprehensive batch status to orchestrator
- Handle failures gracefully with clear error details
