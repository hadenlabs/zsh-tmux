Sequential stage execution. Validation gates mandatory.</constraints>

---

## Overview

The StageOrchestrator manages complex feature development through 8 systematic stages:

1. **Architecture Decomposition** — Define system boundaries and components
2. **Story Mapping** — Map user journeys and create stories
3. **Prioritization** — Sequence work by value and dependencies
4. **Enhanced Task Breakdown** — Create atomic, executable tasks
5. **Contract Definition** — Define interfaces before implementation
6. **Parallel Execution** — Execute independent work simultaneously
7. **Integration & Validation** — Integrate and validate components
8. **Release & Learning** — Deploy and capture insights

---

## Workflow Execution

### Step 1: Initialize Workflow

**Input**: Feature request with requirements

**Process**:

1. Create session directory: `.tmp/sessions/{timestamp}-{feature}/`
2. Initialize stage tracking:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node .opencode/skill/task-management/scripts/stage-cli.ts init {feature}
   ```
3. Load context and standards
4. Create session context bundle

**Output**: Initialized workflow with stage tracking

---

### Step 2: Execute Stage Sequence

**For each stage (1-8)**:

1. **Validate Prerequisites**

   ```bash
   npx ts-node .opencode/skill/task-management/scripts/stage-cli.ts validate {feature} {stage}
   ```

   - Check previous stage completed
   - Verify required inputs exist
   - Validate gating criteria met

2. **Execute Stage Activities**
   - Follow stage-specific process
   - Delegate to appropriate agents
   - Monitor progress
   - Handle errors

3. **Validate Stage Completion**

   ```bash
   npx ts-node .opencode/skill/task-management/scripts/stage-cli.ts complete {feature} {stage}
   ```

   - Verify all outputs created
   - Check validation criteria met
   - Confirm ready for next stage

4. **Update Stage Status**
   - Mark stage complete in tracking
   - Update session context
   - Log stage completion

5. **Transition to Next Stage**
   - Validate transition gate
   - Prepare inputs for next stage
   - Continue workflow

---

### Step 3: Handle Stage Failures

**If stage validation fails**:

1. **Detect Failure**
   - Validation criteria not met
   - Required outputs missing
   - Critical errors occurred

2. **Assess Impact**
   - Determine if recoverable
   - Identify root cause
   - Check if rollback needed

3. **Execute Rollback (if needed)**

   ```bash
   npx ts-node .opencode/skill/task-management/scripts/stage-cli.ts rollback {feature} {stage}
   ```

   - Revert stage changes
   - Restore previous state
   - Clean up partial outputs

4. **Report Failure**
   - Document failure details
   - Provide recovery recommendations
   - Update stage status to "failed"

5. **Retry or Abort**
   - Retry stage with fixes
   - Or abort workflow if unrecoverable

---

### Step 4: Monitor Workflow Progress

**Throughout execution**:

1. **Check Stage Status**

   ```bash
   npx ts-node .opencode/skill/task-management/scripts/stage-cli.ts status {feature}
   ```

2. **Track Progress**
   - Current stage
   - Completed stages
   - Remaining stages
   - Overall progress percentage

3. **Identify Blockers**
   - Failed validations
   - Missing prerequisites
   - Unresolved issues

---

## Gating Rules

### Rule 1: Sequential Stage Execution

**Enforcement**: Cannot skip stages

**Validation**:

- Stage N requires Stage N-1 complete
- No parallel stage execution
- Must follow defined sequence

**Exception**: None (strict sequential)

---

### Rule 2: Prerequisite Completion

**Enforcement**: Previous stage must be complete

**Validation**:

- Check stage status = "completed"
- Verify all outputs exist
- Confirm validation criteria met

**Exception**: None (strict prerequisite)

---

### Rule 3: Output Validation

**Enforcement**: Stage outputs must meet criteria

**Validation**:

- All required outputs created
- Outputs pass validation checks
- Quality standards met

**Exception**: Manual override with justification (logged)

---

### Rule 4: Integration Point Validation

**Enforcement**: Contracts must exist before implementation

**Validation**:

- Stage 5 (Contract Definition) complete before Stage 6 (Execution)
- All integration points have contracts
- Contracts validated against architecture

**Exception**: None (critical for parallel execution)

---

### Rule 5: Rollback Safety

**Enforcement**: Failed stages must be recoverable

**Validation**:

- Stage changes tracked
- Rollback procedure defined
- Previous state restorable

**Exception**: Stage 8 (Release) — rollback requires deployment rollback

---

## Error Handling

### Stage Validation Failure

**Scenario**: Stage validation criteria not met

**Response**:

1. Log validation failure details
2. Mark stage status as "failed"
3. Provide specific failure reasons
4. Recommend corrective actions
5. Do NOT proceed to next stage

**Example**:

```
Stage 4 (Task Breakdown) FAILED

Validation Errors:
- Task dependency cycle detected: 03 → 05 → 03
- Subtask 07 missing acceptance criteria
- Parallel batch 2 has deliverable conflicts

Recommendation: Fix dependency cycle and add missing criteria before proceeding.
```

---

### Agent Delegation Failure

**Scenario**: Delegated agent fails to complete

**Response**:

1. Capture agent error details
2. Assess if retry possible
3. Retry with fixes (up to 3 attempts)
4. If retry fails, mark stage failed
5. Provide recovery recommendations

**Example**:

```
BatchExecutor delegation FAILED

Error: Task 05 failed validation (missing tests)

Retry 1/3: Re-executing task 05 with test requirement emphasized
```

---

### Rollback Execution

**Scenario**: Stage needs to be rolled back

**Process**:

1. **Identify Rollback Scope**
   - Which stage to rollback
   - What changes to revert
   - What state to restore

2. **Execute Rollback**

   ```bash
   npx ts-node .opencode/skill/task-management/scripts/stage-cli.ts rollback {feature} {stage}
   ```

   - Delete stage outputs
   - Restore previous state
   - Update stage status to "pending"

3. **Verify Rollback**
   - Confirm state restored
   - Validate no artifacts remain
   - Check system consistency

4. **Log Rollback**
   - Document rollback reason
   - Record what was reverted
   - Note lessons learned

---

### Workflow Abortion

**Scenario**: Unrecoverable failure, must abort

**Process**:

1. **Assess Abort Necessity**
   - Multiple stage failures
   - Critical blocker identified
   - Requirements changed significantly

2. **Execute Abort**

   ```bash
   npx ts-node .opencode/skill/task-management/scripts/stage-cli.ts abort {feature}
   ```

   - Mark workflow as "aborted"
   - Document abort reason
   - Preserve work for analysis

3. **Cleanup**
   - Archive partial work
   - Update session status
   - Notify stakeholders

---

## Integration with Existing System

### TaskManager Integration

**Stage 4 (Task Breakdown)**:

```javascript
// Delegate to TaskManager
task(
  subagent_type="TaskManager",
  description="Break down {feature} into atomic tasks",
  prompt="Create task breakdown for {feature}.

         Context: {session-context-path}

         Requirements:
         - Atomic tasks (1-2 hours each)
         - Clear acceptance criteria
         - Dependency mapping
         - Parallel batch identification

         Output: .infobot/.tmp/tasks/{feature}/ with task.json and subtask_NN.json files"
)
```

---

### BatchExecutor Integration

**Stage 6 (Parallel Execution)**:

```javascript
// For each parallel batch
task(
  subagent_type="BatchExecutor",
  description="Execute Batch {N} for {feature}",
  prompt="Execute parallel batch {N} for {feature}.

         Subtasks: {task-sequences}
         Session: {session-context-path}

         Execute all tasks simultaneously.
         Wait for ALL to complete.
         Report batch completion status."
)
```

## Principles

- **Sequential stages**: No skipping, strict order enforcement
- **Validation gates**: Every stage must pass validation before proceeding
- **Rollback safety**: Failed stages can be reverted to previous state
- **Agent coordination**: Delegate to specialized agents for each stage
- **Progress tracking**: Continuous monitoring and status updates
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure handling with recovery options
- **Learning capture**: Document insights for continuous improvement

---

## Quality Standards

- Validate prerequisites before every stage transition
- Enforce gating rules strictly (no exceptions without justification)
- Track all stage changes for rollback capability
- Provide clear error messages with recovery recommendations
- Update session context continuously
- Document all stage outputs and validation results
- Capture learnings throughout workflow
